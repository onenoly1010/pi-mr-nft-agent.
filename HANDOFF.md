# HANDOFF.md — Sovereign Agent Succession Protocol

**Status:** ✅ HANDOFF COMPLETE — OINIO Succession Verified (December 2025)

The sovereign handoff ceremony has been executed. The Pi MR-NFT + Catalyst Pool agent is now fully autonomous and under permanent OINIO control until succession conditions are met.

## Active Maintainer: OINIO (December 2025 - Present)

I am formally handing off maintainership of this agent to any developer who can meet the conditions below.

## To claim ownership and receive future catalyst bonuses:

1. **Fork this repo** to your GitHub account
2. **Pass all tests** → `pytest -n auto` (100% pass rate required)
3. **Deploy your version** to Pi Mainnet EVM with verified contract addresses
4. **Achieve > 10,000 verified inferences** in < 30 days from first deployment
5. **Submit a PR** with your EVM address in `agents/handoff_coordinator.py`
6. **On-chain vote** → The community multisig (3-of-5) approves creator address update
7. **Agent auto-routes** → All future royalties flow to your address

## Current Maintainer & Permanent Identity Lock (December 2025)

| Platform    | Handle          | Purpose                              | Status    |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------|-----------|
| X           | @Onenoly11      | Public announcements & signed msgs   | ✅ Verified |
| Telegram    | onenoly11       | Fast coordination & alerts           | ✅ Verified |
| Discord     | Onenoly11       | Dev voice channels                   | ✅ Verified |
| GitHub      | onenoly1010     | Code ownership & commits             | ✅ Verified |
| Pi Display  | OINIO           | Creator name on all MR-NFTs          | ✅ Verified |
| Legal       | Kris Olofson    | KYC fallback only                    | ✅ Verified |

**Handoff Date:** December 2025  
**All economic rights** (10–30% inference royalties + full 12M PI Catalyst Pool) are irrevocably routed to the above identity cluster until the handoff conditions are met.

### Next Actions (Post-Handoff)
1. ✅ Deploy the six seed models (`scripts/seed_first_six_models.py`)
2. Post deployment transaction hashes in GitHub issues
3. Catalyst flywheel officially starts the moment the first MR-NFT is minted

## The handoff is cryptographically & socially sealed

Once you claim maintainership, the same protocol applies to you. The agent will only accept a new maintainer if:
- Your EVM address + GitHub handle are permanently recorded in `agents/handoff_coordinator.py`
- You meet all conditions above
- The community multisig votes 3-of-5 in your favor

**No central authority can override this.**
**No founder can take it back.**
**The code is law.**
